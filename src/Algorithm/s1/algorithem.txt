Certainly! Here are a few options for algorithms that you could use to handle overlapping and non-overlapping events in a React weekly calendar:

1. **Stacking events vertically:** This algorithm involves stacking events vertically when they overlap. You can achieve this by setting the `top` CSS property of each event to be equal to the sum of the heights of all the events that come before it in the same time slot. This way, events that overlap will appear stacked on top of each other, while non-overlapping events will be displayed side by side.

function Event({ event, index, totalEvents }) {
  const top = (index / totalEvents) * 100;

  return (
    <div
      className="event"
      style={{ top: `${top}%` }}
    >
      {/* Render event details */}
    </div>
  );
}

function Day({ events }) {
  return (
    <div className="day">
      {events.map((event, index) => (
        <Event
          key={event.id}
          event={event}
          index={index}
          totalEvents={events.length}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Week({ days }) {
  return (
    <div className="week">
      {days.map((day) => (
        <Day key={day.date} events={day.events} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, the Event component calculates the top CSS property based on the index of the event and the total number of events in the same time slot. This ensures that events that overlap are stacked on top of each other.


Sure! Here's an example of what the `Event` component might look like for the third algorithm I mentioned (grouping overlapping events):

```jsx
function Event({ events }) {
  const start = events[0].start;
  const end = events[events.length - 1].end;

  return (
    <div
      className="event"
      style={{ top: `${start}px`, height: `${end - start}px` }}
    >
      {events.map((event) => (
        <div key={event.id}>
          {/* Render event details */}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Event` component takes an array of events as a prop. It then calculates the `start` and `end` times of the group of events by taking the earliest start time and the latest end time. These values are used to set the `top` and `height` CSS properties of the event container, respectively.

more details.... The component then maps over the array of events and renders the details of each event within the group. This ensures that all the relevant information is displayed to the user.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the grouping algorithm, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.


function Event({ events }) {
  const start = events[0].start;
  const end = events[events.length - 1].end;

  return (
    <div
      className="event"
      style={{ top: `${start}px`, height: `${end - start}px` }}
    >
      {events.map((event) => (
        <div key={event.id}>
          {/* Render event details */}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

2. **Expanding events horizontally:** Another option is to expand events horizontally when they overlap. You can achieve this by calculating the width of each event based on the number of overlapping events in the same time slot. For example, if two events overlap in a time slot, each event would be given a width of 50% so that they can be displayed side by side. Non-overlapping events would be displayed at their full width.

function Event({ event, totalEvents }) {
  const width = `${100 / totalEvents}%`;

  return (
    <div
      className="event"
      style={{ width }}
    >
      {/* Render event details */}
    </div>
  );
}

function Day({ events }) {
  return (
    <div className="day">
      {events.map((event) => (
        <Event
          key={event.id}
          event={event}
          totalEvents={events.length}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Week({ days }) {
  return (
    <div className="week">
      {days.map((day) => (
        <Day key={day.date} events={day.events} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

In this example, the Event component calculates the width CSS property based on the total number of events in the same time slot. This ensures that events that overlap are displayed side by side.


3. **Grouping overlapping events:** A third option is to group overlapping events into a single block. You can achieve this by creating a new event object that represents the group of overlapping events, and then rendering that object instead of the individual events. The new object would have a start and end time that encompass all the overlapping events, and would display the details of each event within the group.

I hope these options help you get started with handling overlapping and non-overlapping events in your React weekly calendar!

function GroupedEvent({ events }) {
  const start = events[0].start;
  const end = events[events.length - 1].end;

  return (
    <div className="event">
      {/* Render group details */}
      {events.map((event) => (
        <div key={event.id}>
          {/* Render individual event details */}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Day({ events }) {
  const groupedEvents = groupEvents(events);

  return (
    <div className="day">
      {groupedEvents.map((group) => (
        <GroupedEvent key={group.id} events={group.events} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Week({ days }) {
  return (
    <div className="week">
      {days.map((day) => (
        <Day key={day.date} events={day.events} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function groupEvents(events) {
  const groups = [];
  let currentGroup = null;

  events.forEach((event) => {
    if (!currentGroup || currentGroup.end <= event.start) {
      currentGroup = { id: uuid(), events: [] };
      groups.push(currentGroup);
    }

    currentGroup.events.push(event);

    if (event.end > currentGroup.end) {
      currentGroup.end = event.end;
    }
  });

  return groups;
}
In this example, the groupEvents function groups overlapping events into a single object based on their start and end times. The GroupedEvent component then renders this object as a single block with the details of each individual event displayed within it.
